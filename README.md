<h3>About: </h3>
We implement the proximal policy optimization algorithm based on the paper: [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf). We try different extensions like entropic regularization and
implement exploration through [Random Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12894.pdf). 

<h3>TODO LIST</h3>
<li>1. Make a good working logger compatible with TensorboardX/wandb</li>
<li>2. Apply this to the MarsExploration Env </li>
